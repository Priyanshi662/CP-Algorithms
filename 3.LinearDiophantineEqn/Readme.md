# Linear Diophantine Equation
## A linear Diophantine Equation is of the form ax+by=c
## where a,b,c are known and x,y are unknown
# There are some use cases of Linear Diophantine equation - 
## 1. to find whether the given parameter a,b,c have a solution or not - For example Ebony and ivory question on codeforces
## 2. Given coins of two denominations,find what is the largest possible n which cannot be purchased with a,b - This question depends on the gcd of two coins
# The solution to the Linear Diophantine equation exists only is c if divisible by the gcd of a,b
